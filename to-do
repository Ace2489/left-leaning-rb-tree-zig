-- diagrams for function documenentation
-- deinit method for the tree
-- automated tests for appropriate actions in balancing scenarios: right red links, double-left red links, red children
-- automated tests to ensure LLRB constraints for all operations:
    - No right links, no double-left red links, and no red right and left children
    - The BST property, and height adherence to O(Log n), as well as b-tree bijection
